# PHP eval based encoding decoder
Experimental program to automatically decode of PHP eval based encoding.

## Usage
```bash
php php-eb-decoder.php <filename>
```

## Disclaimer
This solution is experimental and executes code in given files. Some encoded files can contain malware that will be executed by emulator. I recomend to use this program in sandbox in fully controlled environment.
